# Queue-Implementation
Simple Queue implementation built off an array, for a quick data structures refresher

This program utilizes the following methods: insert(long j), remove(), peekFront(), isEmpty(), isFull(), and view(). To clarify,
  insert(long j) inserts the value j at the front of the queue. View() prints the contents of the queue to the console.

Queue is given its own class and has the following attributes: maxSize, myQueue, front, rear, and items. maxSize is the maximum size
  of the queue. myQueue is the array the queue is utilized through. Front is the front index of the queue, and rear is the rear index
  of the queue. Items is the number of items in the queue.
